# Data Science Portfolio
This portfolio is a repository of all the projects I've done in the realm of data science.
As I'm currently studying Data Science, these projects vary in length, complexity, and are a reflection of my learning curve. These projects primarily demonstrate my skills in Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualizations, Machine Learning, and Communication.

## DataCamp Projects
A list of short projects done which were found within DataCamp's website. These projects were intended for practice and provided me with an inital exposure to Data Science Projects.

* [**Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing**](https://github.com/abandlap/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/DataCamp%20Projects/handwashing_project.ipynb) - Reanalyzing the data that made Dr. Semmelweis discover the importance of handwashing in clinics.<br>
**Libraries:** Pandas

* [**Exploring 67 Years of Lego**](https://github.com/abandlap/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/DataCamp%20Projects/lego_project.ipynb) - Exploring a database of every LEGO set ever built.<br>
**Libraries:** Pandas

* [**Gender Prediction Using Sound**](https://github.com/abandlap/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/DataCamp%20Projects/gender_prediction_project.ipynb) - Analyzing the gender distribution of best selling children's book writers and using a phonetic algorithm to predict their gender based on their name.<br>
**Libraries:** Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Fuzzy


## Projects from Post Grad Diploma in Data Science
Longer projects done as a part of my Post Grad Diploma course in Data Science from International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore.

* **GDP Analysis - Indian States** - Analyzing the GDP information of every state and union territory of India in the context of industry and education.<br>
