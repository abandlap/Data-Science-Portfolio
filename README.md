# Data Science Portfolio
This portfolio is a repository of all the projects I've done in the realm of data science.
As I'm currently studying Data Science, these projects vary in length, complexity, and are a reflection of my learning curve. These projects primarily demonstrate my skills in Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualizations, Machine Learning, and Communication.
